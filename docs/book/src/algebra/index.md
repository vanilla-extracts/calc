# Chapter VI. Algebra

The calculator supports basic algebraic calculations, including

- Vectors
  - Dot product (operator `*` - with another vector.)
  - Scalar product (operator `*` - with a scalar.)
  - Norm (function `norm`)
  - Addition (operator `+`)
- Matrices
  - Addition (operator `+`)
  - Multiplication (operator `*` - with another matrix.)
  - Scalar multiplication (operator `*` - with a scalar.)
  - Transposition (function `transpose`)
  - Determinant (via _LUP-decomposition_ function `det`)
  - Inversion (via _LUP-decomposition_ function `invert`)

The matrices (and vectors) are pretty printed (and aligned) (since `v2.11.5`)
