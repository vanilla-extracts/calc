# Chapter I. Usage 

## Basic Operators

Calc supports basic arithmetic operators such as:

- `+` 
- `*`
- `-`
- `/`
- `^`

## Variables

The calculators also implements a system of (for the moment all global)
variables.

The syntax is simple, close to python. Its type-abilities are close to python
too, you can re-assign a variable with another value of another type.
```
var = 5 
```
